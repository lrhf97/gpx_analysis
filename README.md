# gpx_analysis
This is a group of notebooks and .py files where I am taking the gpx file data from my garmin and recreating some of the capabilities of a strava or a run evaluation app.
Found inside
- Generating mile markers and run pace tags for a map of the run.
- Calculating elevation gain and differeing pace per grade of gain or loss
- logging in the maps, elevation, and analysis of various routes where the gpx files are available
